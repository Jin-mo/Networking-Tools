# Networking Tools


This GitHub repository houses a collection of essential networking tools written in Python. Currently, the repository includes source code for two fundamental programs: a TCP client and server, as well as a UDP client.

**Features:**

1. **TCP Client and Server:**
   - The TCP client and server programs provide a foundation for establishing reliable, connection-oriented communication over a network. Use these tools to facilitate data exchange between devices with a focus on ordered and error-checked delivery.

2. **UDP Client:**
   - The UDP client program offers a lightweight, connectionless communication option. Ideal for scenarios where speed is crucial and a minimalistic approach is preferred, the UDP client supports the transmission of independent packets without the overhead of maintaining a continuous connection.

**Usage:**

- Integrate the provided Python scripts into your networking projects to kickstart the development of customized applications.
- Leverage the TCP client and server for applications requiring a reliable, stream-oriented communication protocol.
- Explore the UDP client for scenarios where a connectionless, fast data transfer is more appropriate.

**How to Get Started:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/networking-tools.git
   ```

2. Dive into the `tcp-client`, `tcp-server`, and `udp-client` directories to explore the source code and start incorporating these tools into your projects.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or extend the functionality of these networking tools. Let's build robust and efficient networked applications together!

**Contributing:**
